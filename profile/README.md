# TONFT | NFT Bazaar 

**TONFT** is a decentralized and open source **NFT bazaar-marketplace** where you can have **optional 0 royalties** on any **NFT sale**. Also, we invented and developed **smart fee system**, which is similar to real estate agents but in NFT world (described in the features below). The system creates incentives to trade NFTs more → contributes to the entire TON market volumes in general.

The **features** we are proud of: 

1. **Optional Royalty** — you can have 0% royalty on any NFT sale;
2. **Smart Fees** — we don’t just have the marketplace fee we have referral fees - If a person shares his link to the NFT offer, the marketplace fee goes to the person. If link is our (meaning the link from the tonft website) only then we get a marketplace fee;
3. **Highload Wallet Server** — capable to process more than 250 tx per second. Helps to send fee rewards to the users;
4. **NFT Marketplace Contract and Deployer** — allows to create NFT sales with different options like 0 royalties or the smart fees;
5. ************************Alert Bot************************ — notifies users in a telegram channel about new offers on the market;
6. ********************The first open source NFT marketplace on TON in general.********************

Since the **start** of the hackathon (start of development) we were able to deliver MVP and already **sold** NFTs for **>3107 TON** and have **>30 unique wallets.**
